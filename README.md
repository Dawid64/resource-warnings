# Memory tracking extension for MacOS

## Background

I'm was working with machine learning and videos recently on my mac, and because of improper loading video my RAM usage skyrocket, but I didn't notice that until I checked after few minutes activity monitor and saw yellow and red memory pressure :(. To save my computer I decided to install some extension that will show me how much RAM I'm using, so I tried few different ones, but ... non of them showed even similar value to this displayed by my activity monitor. After that I've done some simple research try few different things, and find some approach that actually gave me the desired value :D. The extension is not High Quality yet, if anyone have any ideas for improvement, I recommend checking out this project on github and making some pull request, I will try to merge it or answer as quick as possible.
